**Introduction:**
The objective of the given project was to learn the implementation of the basic knowledge of C programming language in our practical life scenario. C programming lab was designed to introduce us with a programming language as well as to enhance our knowledge of the programming language C. This project was an introduction to a different side of the world of programming like that game development, apps development etc. Since it is our first ever game project during our undergraduate first year second semester, so during the implementation of the project we have learnt a lot of things related with C/C++ programming language.
